# Computing BTEC Summer Work

## Task 1 - Complete the Python video tutorial course

A key part of this course is programming for a range of purposes using a variety of programming paradigms. To start with we will be looking at procedural programming using Python. after we will extend this into object-oriented programming, event driven programming and programming for the web and will then apply what you have learned to build mobile apps.

We know that you will all have different experiences and starting points with this work and that for some of you this will all be new, whilst for others much of this work will be revision. Either way, you will have all been out of formal education for several months and that getting back into learning, refreshing existing skills and learning new ones in preparation for college is really important and will help you to make a flying start.

### What will I need?

You will need to be able to write, save and run Python programs to complete this task. Ideally you should follow the instructions in the video to install Python and PyCharm on your computer but if you are not able to do that then you can do these tasks in a browser using Trinket instead. There is a separate section of the document that tells you how to do this.

### What do I do?

To prepare for the programming part of the course, we would like you to complete the 4 Â½ hour Python video tutorial you will find here.

You will write all the programs along with the presenter and save each program ready to hand in when you start college in September.

- The tutorial starts by showing you how to install Python and PyCharm on your computer and you should do this if you can then use them to write and run your programs. If you are cannot do this then see the section below about how to use Trinket in a browser to write your programs instead.
- The video is divided into a series of tutorials, each focusing on a key Python programming concept or skills and coding an example.
- You should code along with the presenter and save your program at the end of every tutorial into a .py file with the same name as the tutorial it goes with (see the list below)

### What to hand in:

Bring all your programs to your first lesson in college when you start in September. You could use a USB stick, email or cloud based storage such as Google Drive or One Drive for this.

This is a list of all the programs you will be writing as you work through the tutorials and they should all be brought to your first lesson:

1. Set up and Hello World
2. Drawing a Shape
3. Variables and data types
4. Working with Strings
